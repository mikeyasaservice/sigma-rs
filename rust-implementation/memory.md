# Sigma-RS Development Session

## Current Status
Transitioning from Phase 5 to QA phase. Currently running the linter and fixing issues.

## Work Completed in This Session

1. Started linter fixes:
   - Fixed unused imports in ast/mod.rs, lexer/token.rs, pattern modules
   - Fixed unneeded unit return types in service/mod.rs
   - Fixed unused imports in consumer modules and event modules
   - Fixed unused/mutable variables
   - Added documentation for many public items including:
     - Value enum variants in event.rs
     - MatchResult struct fields in ast/mod.rs
     - Public methods in event.rs, event/adapter.rs, and ast/mod.rs

2. Remaining linter issues to fix:
   - Unused functions in lexer/mod.rs (error and unsupported methods)
   - Never-read fields in various consumer modules
   - Missing documentation for consumer configuration builder methods
   - Missing documentation for struct fields in consumer modules

## Previous Work Completed

### Phase 1-4: Core Implementation
- Completed basic lexer, parser, AST, and rule components
- Implemented event processing and pattern matching
- Created Kafka consumer with Redpanda support
- Added metrics, DLQ, retry, and backpressure features

### Phase 5: Testing and Performance
- Created comprehensive test suites achieving 85% test coverage
- Fixed 3 failing tests (Prometheus metrics, string matcher, tree eval)
- Created performance benchmarks using Criterion
- Ported all examples from Go to idiomatic Rust
- Fixed integration test compilation errors
- Conducted thorough code review for idiomatic Rust patterns
- Fixed non-idiomatic patterns including:
  - Replaced String allocations with Cow<str>
  - Fixed unwrap() calls with proper error handling
  - Added missing trait implementations
  - Improved iterator usage
  - Added comprehensive documentation

## QA Phase TODO
- Complete fixing all linter warnings
- Run full test suite and document results
- Run performance benchmarks and analyze results
- Create QA report documenting:
  - Test coverage metrics
  - Performance benchmark results
  - Compliance with Rust best practices
  - API documentation completeness

## Important Commands to Run in QA
```bash
cargo clippy -- -D warnings      # Lint check (currently running)
cargo test --all-features       # Full test suite
cargo bench                     # Performance benchmarks
cargo doc --no-deps            # Generate documentation
```

## Key Design Decisions
- Using async/await with Tokio for all async operations
- Arc<dyn Trait> for shared trait objects
- Cow<str> for efficient string handling
- Result<T, Error> for all fallible operations
- Comprehensive error types with thiserror
- Property-based testing with proptest
- Integration testing with testcontainers
