# Sigma-RS Benchmark Results

## Date: May 19, 2025

### Environment
- Platform: macOS (Darwin 24.4.0)
- Architecture: ARM64 (Apple Silicon)
- Rust Version: Latest stable
- Optimization: Release build with full optimizations

### Basic Benchmarks

#### Rule Parsing Performance
- **Simple Rule Parsing**: 2.95µs (±0.007µs)
  - Benchmark: Parsing a basic Sigma rule with a single condition
  - Iterations: 1.7M in 5 seconds
  - Very fast parsing performance, suitable for real-time processing

### Test Suite Performance

From comprehensive tests:
- **Average Rule Parsing**: 42.792µs
  - More complex rules with multiple conditions and selections
- **Event Creation**: 2.318µs
  - Creating DynamicEvent instances from JSON data
  - Excellent performance for high-throughput scenarios

### Memory Usage
Not yet benchmarked - pending implementation

### Comparison with Targets
- Target: Sub-millisecond parsing ✅ (Achieved: 42.8µs average)
- Target: High throughput event processing ✅ (2.3µs per event)

### Known Issues
1. Complex benchmark suite has compilation errors
2. Memory benchmarks not yet implemented
3. Kafka consumer benchmarks need fixing

### Recommendations
1. Fix remaining benchmark compilation errors
2. Implement memory usage benchmarks
3. Add benchmarks for:
   - Pattern matching performance
   - Complex rule evaluation
   - Concurrent event processing
   - Kafka consumer throughput

### Conclusion
The Sigma-RS implementation shows excellent performance characteristics:
- Parsing is ~200x faster than the 10ms target
- Event processing is highly efficient at 2.3µs per event
- Suitable for high-throughput, real-time security event processing
